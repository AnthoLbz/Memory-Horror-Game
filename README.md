Memory Horror Game
- I coded this game with my team mates for our 2nd project, during my Web Develloper course @ Wild Code School Marseille.
-You can play it here: 
-Do not read the code to learn something, it's probably full of bad practices.
-For now, I don't have time to clean the code.
-Hopefully sometime in the future I will.
-Have fun!
